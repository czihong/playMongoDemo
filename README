This app is used to show how to connect mongodb in play 2.0.4 framework via morphia.

PS:Please inspect these three files, 
	app/models/Group.java,
	app/controllers/Application.java
	project/Build.scala

One more thing, after download the source code, do remember add the mongodb-java-driver and morphia jar files into project class path.

1) after the Build.scala has loaded, 

   morphia jar file at 
   {play2-home-dir}/repository/cache/com.google.code.morphia/morphia/jars

   mongo-java-driver jar file at 
   {play2-home-dir}/repository/cache/org.mongodb/mongo-java-driver/jars
   
OR

2) separately download the jars and put them in the {project}/lib folder
